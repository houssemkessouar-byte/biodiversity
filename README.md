**L’impact du changement climatique sur la sécurité alimentaire mondial** (The Impact of Climate Change on Global Food Security)[cite: 1].

[cite_start]The work establishes that **climate change is a major environmental threat** severely affecting global agricultural systems and endangering **food security**, which is defined as guaranteeing sufficient, stable, and nutritious food access for all[cite: 22, 23].

## Key Findings and Impacts

### Direct Impacts on Food Production
[cite_start]Climate change directly disrupts food production through[cite: 25]:
* [cite_start]**Extreme Events:** Droughts, floods, and heatwaves disrupt agricultural cycles[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**Ecosystem Degradation:** Deterioration of marine ecosystems impacts fishing[cite: 28].
* [cite_start]**Land Issues:** Degradation of soils and salinization reduce land fertility[cite: 29].
* [cite_start]**Water Scarcity:** A drop in freshwater resources affects irrigation[cite: 30].

### Socio-Economic Consequences
[cite_start]These impacts have severe socio-economic consequences, including[cite: 31]:
* [cite_start]**Malnutrition & Famine:** Increased risks for vulnerable populations[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Poverty:** Rising food prices limit access to food for poor households[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Conflict & Migration:** Forced migration and conflicts linked to food resource scarcity[cite: 35].

## Challenges and Strategies

### Future Challenges
[cite_start]The main challenge is the **anticipated intensification of extreme climatic events**[cite: 38]. [cite_start]To meet growing demand, there is a necessity to adopt scientific innovations, strengthen the **resilience of agricultural systems**, and promote the **sustainable management of natural resources**[cite: 37, 39, 40].

### Adaptation Strategies & Recommendations
[cite_start]Strategies to adapt and ensure food security include[cite: 42]:
* [cite_start]**Policy:** Reinforced public policies to support farmers[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]**Farming Practices:** Promotion of **sustainable agricultural practices** such as agroecology and drought-resistant crops[cite: 44].
* [cite_start]**Cooperation:** International cooperation to secure food supply chains[cite: 46].
* [cite_start]**Technology:** Technological innovations for irrigation and climate monitoring[cite: 47].

## Conclusion
[cite_start]Ensuring global food security requires **combining local, national, and international actions** to implement sustainable agricultural practices and suitable policies[cite: 50, 51]. [cite_start]This demands **innovation, cooperation, and responsible resource management**[cite: 51].
